Objectives: to get rid of neck pain, to reduce recovery time after surgery, to keep the body in tone due to the lack of active sports, to soften severely tense muscles and possibly add some stretch marks. It all started with an upper body massage (neck, back), as these were priority things. After a couple of weeks, a full-body massage course was started (taking into account that the diseased knee and ankle could not be much disturbed).

  "I heard good reviews about Yumeiho for a long time, and it was very interesting to try. This massage is more like gymnastics with a deep joint workout. The first impression is that you feel unusual after twisting. After the third session, I felt a lightness in my whole body and a surge of energy. And then just a pleasure. A very cool massage experience! I will repeat the course with great pleasure, because outwardly, changes for the better are also visible.

  "Statistics say that about 98% of people have a displacement of the pelvic bones almost since childhood. The reasons for the displacement can be very different: during pregnancy and childbirth in mothers, at birth in children, with falls, bruises, the habit of sitting in the wrong position, work associated with heavy physical exertion, a sedentary lifestyle. The body is a single system of levers and ligaments, when the displacement of any of its lever-joint necessarily cause the displacement in all other joints in one degree or another. The center of the body is the line of intersection of the spine and the line of the ilium (line of the pelvis). By analogy, we can say that the pelvic bone is the (foundation of the building), and the spine and limbs are its (walls). Therefore, it is easy to imagine when they say, (the foundation has floated), the walls start to collapse.

  "Vietnamese massage is focused more on stretching, so we do it less often than Japanese one. At first, I felt like my muscles were clogged, but with each new session it got easier. I slowly learned to relax physically (feel less pain) and mentally (learn to throw away thoughts), more stretch marks appeared (for example, it became noticeable on the butterfly exercise for the hip joint). Weekly one-hour trainings help to feel better both physically and psychologically. Massage works especially well during sports activities (for example, swimming). Then the effect of it is multiplied. Achieved goals: neck pain disappeared after a few sessions, recovery after surgery has passed fast due to a gradual increase in the load on the sick places. Despite periods when it was difficult to exercise (lockdowns, bad weather, injury), a weekly attendance allowed keeping the body in good shape. The whole sensation of the body is become easier due to the elimination of blocks in the muscles.
